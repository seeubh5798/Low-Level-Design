# Behavioural Design pattern
    Covers
    Memento design pattern - Undo redo funcionality
    Observer design pattern - publishers subscriber model
    Strategy design pattern - Runtime polymorphism question for payment selection
    Command design pattern - Event emitted rum time method call example
    TemplateMethod pattern - making beverage with similar steps and their own separate steps in separate codes, other example could be Covers parsing of a text to json, csv  etc example, 
    Iterator pattern - Notification Management System Application Exercise
                        You are tasked with designing a notification management system that allows users to iterate over their notifications in a sequential manner. The system will manage different types of notifications, such as:
                        Email notifications
                        SMS notifications
                        Push notifications
                        Each type of notification should be stored in its own collection. The system must provide a way to access and iterate over these notifications one by one, without exposing the underlying structure or implementation of the collections.
                        Task:
                        Implement the iteration functionality for the notification system using the Iterator Design Pattern. Ensure that your solution can be extended easily to accommodate future types of notifications without modifying existing code. The system should allow users to navigate through all types of notifications seamlessly.
    State Pattern -     Maps quesition with different strategy for getting ETA implemented.
    Mediator pattern -  Group chat implemented.


# Creational design pattern
    Covers
    Singleton Design patttern - Bill Pugh Solution implemented
    Builder Pattern - When an obj requires too many option params in constructor, we use builder pattern to avoid constructor explosion.Uses nwsted Nuilder class and getters/setters to create Outerclass object
    FactoryPattern - provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class that will be instantiated. Instead of calling the constructor directly, a factory method is used to create objects based on input conditions
    Abstract FactoryPattern -provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    Prototype Pattern - mainly used for object cloning from existing objects

# Structural design pattern
    Covers
    Adapter pattern - useful to create link between two incompatible classes /methods e.g integrating 3rd party with lgeacy systems.
    Proxy Pattern - Example used is to create a proxy service with cache to avoid direct interaction with original object.
    Composite pattern - create strcuture for files and folders where both are treated with uniformity example. Generally used for hierarchical structures.
