    Iterator pattern - Notification Management System Application Exercise
                        You are tasked with designing a notification management system that allows users to iterate over their notifications in a sequential manner. The system will manage different types of notifications, such as:
                        Email notifications
                        SMS notifications
                        Push notifications
                        Each type of notification should be stored in its own collection. The system must provide a way to access and iterate over these notifications one by one, without exposing the underlying structure or implementation of the collections.
                        Task:
                        Implement the iteration functionality for the notification system using the Iterator Design Pattern. Ensure that your solution can be extended easily to accommodate future types of notifications without modifying existing code. The system should allow users to navigate through all types of notifications seamlessly.
